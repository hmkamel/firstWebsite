    <h3>Hello World!</h3>
    <p> The purpose of this website is to document my journey in learning about Web Development as well as serve as
        practice as I learn.
        Also it'll be interesting to see how much I've developed as a aspiring web developer.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It is important to keep your lines of code structured in order for it to be more legible.</li>
        <li>Such as to have everything included in your head & body to be indented.</li>
        <li>Best practices is to replace <i>italics</i> with <em>emphasis</em> as well as replace <b>bold</b> with
            <strong>strong.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Using <em><strong>alt</strong></em> after inserting an image URL can be good for search enging optimization
            because Google uses alt texts to find out what a webpage is all about.</li>
        <li>Anchors can be used as <strong><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/such">such</a></strong>.
        </li>
        <li>When creating Forms on HTML I would not recommend to put it into a table format.</li>
